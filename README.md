## NodeJS Rest API
A NodeJS Rest API with MongoDB integration.
The application is based opon a phonebook type application, where you can add, update and delete contacts from a mongodb database. The application has a intuitive graphical userinterface, for the ease of usage. The GUI can always be swithed out to something else than the existing one.

# Requirements to get it running
- You will need a MongoDB database and a user with read/write permissions. <a href="https://account.mongodb.com/account/login?n=%2Fv2&nextHash=%23org%2F5e5bd8f04f60464ee7454e95%2Fprojects">Link here</a>
- Nextup you need to have a ".env" file in your project directory, with "DATABASE_URL=", followed by the monogdb connection string.
- Last, you need to run a "npm instalL" when you clone the directory, to install every package needed.
