# NodeJS Rest API
A nodeJS Rest API with MongoDB integration.

The API is used to control a kind of phonebook, where you can create, update and delete your contacts.

## Requirements to use it.
Firstly you need to get all the packages used in the API. You can get them by typing: "npm install" in your command prompt or teminal. When npm will install every package based on what is inside the package.json file.

After installing all the packages, you need a MongoDB database, or Cluster, to connect to.
1. Create a mongodb database.
2. Make a .env file
3. Enter "DATABASE_URL=" followed by the "connection string".

When all this is done, you should be able to use the REST API.
